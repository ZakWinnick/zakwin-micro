However, I think I can get over that with the rest of my points...</li>\n \t<li>This is an amazing piece of technology. What they packed in there is just insane.</li>\n \t<li>It essentially eliminated the need for pretty much every tech-driven device in your house.</li>\n \t<li>You no longer need a TV, sound system, or a computer.</li>\n \t<li>Obviously, I am writing this *right after* the Keynote, so I don't know what connectivity looks like, so there could be more on this list.</li>\n \t<li>Looking at it from an enterprise perspective, the $3499 price tag is roughly in the mid-point of what companies spend on new hire equipment and setup. Just give them one of these, and they're set (even for remote work).</li>\n \t<li>All the tech that Apple has been working on for, at least, the past 5-7 years was to get to this product. It's quite remarkable.</li>\n</ul>\nThat's all for now. I'm sure I'll have more thoughts as I watch videos from the demo area, and subsequent follow-up videos from my favorite tech peeps.\n",
